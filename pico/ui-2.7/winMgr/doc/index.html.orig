<h3>Overview</h3>
This application is a Qt implementation of the controls and
monitoring widgets for interracting with the soft IOC
which does IO with the hardware.  EPICS aware widgets are used
to do Channel Access IO with IOC PVs.  The Epics aware widgets
were developed at Australian Synchrotron Laboratory.
Andrew Rhyder is one of the developers and a contact person.
Documentation on the EPICS aware widgets, or QCA framework, can be found
in /afs/slac/g/testfac/tools/epicsQt/R1.1.6.2/documentation.
<h3>Hardware</h3>
The hardware consists of NewFocus 8752 Ethernet controller and
a number of 8753 Intelligent Pico Motor Drivers.  Each driver
controls up to three pico motors.  In the NLCTA implementation
we use only two of the three motors, A and C, to effect horizontal
and vertical moves of optical elements.
<h3>Soft IOC</h3>
<p>The soft IOC program uses
<a href="/afs/slac/g/testfac/workspace/zms/rhel5/R3.14.11/mod/motor/new/documentation/motorRecord.html"> motor record</a> and a support module "pico".
The support module is a subclass of the
<a href="/afs/slac/g/testfac/workspace/zms/rhel5/R3.14.11/mod/asyn/R4.17/documentation/asynPortDriver.html">asyn Port Driver class</a>
