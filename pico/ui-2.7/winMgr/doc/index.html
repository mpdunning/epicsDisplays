<h3>Overview</h3>
This application is a Qt implementation of the controls and
monitoring widgets for interracting with the soft IOC
which does IO with the hardware.  EPICS aware widgets are used
to do Channel Access IO with IOC PVs.  The Epics aware widgets
were developed at Australian Synchrotron Laboratory.
Andrew Rhyder is one of the developers and a contact person.
Documentation on the EPICS aware widgets, or QCA framework, can be found
in /afs/slac/g/testfac/tools/epicsQt/R1.1.6.2/documentation.

<h3>Hardware</h3>
The hardware consists of NewFocus 8752 Ethernet controller and
a number of 8753 Intelligent Pico Motor Drivers.  Each driver
controls up to three pico motors.  In the NLCTA implementation
we use only two of the three motors, A and C, for  horizontal
and vertical moves of optical elements.

<a name="Qt GUI"></a>
<h3> Qt GUI</h3>
The main window is implemented as a Multi Display Interface (MDI).  When the
program is started, the main window is created with dialogs, one for each
group of motors.  A group corresponds to a set of three Pico Motors controlled
by a Driver Card (8753).  The number of dialogs, labels and macros are specified
in a setup file (picosetup.txt), which is read at program startup time.  The
file is located in $TOOLS/display/pico/ui directory.  Each dialog shows
a number of buttons.  Some of these buttons send commands to the
<a href="#Soft IOC">soft IOC</a>, these will be refered as command buttons.
while other buttons are used to pop up other dialogs and will be refered to as
show buttons.

<h4> Command Buttons</h4>
The command buttons are setup to request that a motor is moved by the number
of steps shown in the button label.  There are four groups of five buttons each.
These four groups are arranged in a way to suggest the direction of motion:
left - right and up - down.  Each pair of groups of buttons controls a motor:
left - right controls motor A and up - down controls motor C.  Motor B is not
used.  In addition there also are read back values for each motor.  A pair of
values is shown for each motor, one of these is the analog read back value, the
other is raw read back value.  Since for Pico motors we set engineering unit
to be a step, hence the pair of RBVs shows the same value.

<h4>Show Buttons</h4>
There are two groups of three buttons labeled Motor, Detail, and Debug.  Again,
each group is associated with a motor.  Aditional button More allows to access
a dialog to control the middle motor (B).  It is there just in case.

<ul>
<li> Motor button is used to pop up a dialog, which allows more complete
     control and positioning of the associated motor. </li>
<li> Detail button is used to pop a dialog, which allows controling various
     aspects of the <a href="motorRecord.html"> motor record</a>.</li>
<li> Debug button is used to pop up a dialog, which shows values of various
     fields in the <a href="motorRecord.html"> motor record</a>.
     As the name suggests, it is used for debugging.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Soft IOC"></a>
<h3>Soft IOC</h3>
<p>The soft IOC program uses
<a href="motorRecord.html"> motor record</a> and a support module "pico".
The support module is a subclass of the asynMotorAxis and asynMotorController
classes.  The latter of these two is a subclass of
<a href="asynPortDriver.html">asyn Port Driver class</a>
<p>Since the Pico Motors support only relative moves, the software was designed
to match that.  When the IOC is started, motor step counters are set to 0 for
all motors regardless of their actual position.  Subsequently, the position
for each motor is calculated by adding the incremental motor moves.  This way
some semblance of actual motor position is maintained.
<p> It is observed that Pico Motors do not have a constant step size.
Typically, to rotate the motor shaft CCW it takes up to twice the number
of steps as it does to rotate it CW in each case through the same angle
of rotation.  Step size also varies as the shaft is screwed in or out.
Furthermore, step size varies greatly from motor to motor.
CW rotation is achieved with a positive number of
steps and CCW with a negative number of steps.
