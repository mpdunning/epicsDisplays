  "The hardware consists of BK9000 Ethernet Coupler followed by bus terminals: KL2531, KL2541, which"

  "The programming model for these Beckhoff devices is a bit complicated.  Typically, two in and two out"
  "registers are visible to the controlling software.  A number of hidden registers are accessed via the"
  "visible registers.  This makes programming difficult since reading from or writing to a hidden register"
  "can't be performed as an atomic operation.  The motor controller has three read and three write visible"
  "registers and a few hundred hidden registers.  The set position and actual position values are 32 bit and"
  "these are implemented as two registers, low order word and high order word.  Hence, reading the"
  "actual position is a complex operation and can fail, which due to the limitations of the Modbus driver"
  "software used."
